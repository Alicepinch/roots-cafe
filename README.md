## UX

The UX goal for this website is to ensure the website is as clear as possible for users to get to all the information that they need. This will be achieved by a simple website structure with 3 separate pages with the two different User journeys as the main focus. This will be; new customers who are looking for a new cafe to visit who stumble upon Roots Cafe, and existing customers who want to get in contact/see whats new and view our menu.

## User Stories:

From being both a new customer and existing customer for many Cafe's myself, asking friends and family and doing some online research I came up with these user stories.

#### New customer:

- As a new customer I would want to learn about Roots Cafe.
- As a new customer I would like to know the opening times of the cafe.
- As a new customer I would like to know where the cafe is located and how to get there.
- As a new customer I would like to be able to get in contact with the cafe if I had any questions.
- As a new customer I would like some visuals of what to expect from the cafe.
- As a new customer I would like to see some reviews from previous customers.
- As a new customer I would like to see the menu options and whether I would be interested in what is on offer.

#### Existing customer:

- As an existing customer who has already visited Roots Cafe before I would like to be able to view the menu to see if anything new has been added/ to plan what I will eat.
- As an existing customer I would like to be able to get in contact to book a table/ if I have any questions.
- As an existing customer I would like to know the steps being taken to keep up with the current climate.

### Strategy
---

The main goal of the Roots Cafe website it to encourage users to become new customers. We will achieve this by providing an online experience of what they can expect when they come to the cafe via our menu, photos and overall design which will be similar to the feel of the actual cafe. It also aims to keep existing customers informed on current situations which may have an effect on opening times of the cafe, and also to keep them up to date with the menu's and anything that might be new.

#### Business Goals:

- Create an impression of the look and feel of the cafe and what it is about.
- Encourage users to book a table/ get in contact.
- Provide information users need to visit.
- Inform the user of Menu options.
- Give the user visuals of what the food looks like.

![Menu wireframe](/docs/wireframes/menu-wireframes.png)

### Surface:
---

#### Design:

For the overall design of this project I want it to be simple, clean and crisp with not too much going on which may overwhelm the customer.

#### Typography:

The first font that I have decided to use for this project was Overpass from Googlefonts, it was recommended that Raleway complimented this font well so I chose to use this alongside. The fall back font that I am using is sans-sherif.
Raleway will be used for headers and overpass for body text.

#### Colour Scheme

As the colour green is normally associated with Vegetarianism and Veganism, I have decided to use green as the main colour focus for this project. I want the website to be clean and crisp therefore I chose to stick with only green and not introduce any other bold colours.
For links and CTA's I have decided to used the lighter green, and the darker green will be used for when hovering over for contrast. Dark grey will be used for the font colour and white for the background. I will also used the light green colour as background for some sections across the website to create consistency and break up the white.
