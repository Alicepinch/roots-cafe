This website is built for Roots cafe, a Vegetarian and Vegan Cafe. The website is built to inform customers on what food the Cafe offers via the menu & gallery section. An about us section with some background on why this was started, and also the location for customers to find the Cafe as well as a form to get in contact/book.

## UX
The UX goal for this website is to ensure the website is as clear as possible for customers to get to the information that they need. This will be achieved by a simple website structure with 3 seperate pages with the two different User journeys as the main focus. These focus's will be, New customers who are looking for a new cafe to visit who stumble upon Roots Cafe and Exisiting customers who want to get in contact/see whats new and view our menu.  

## User Stories:

From being both a new customer and existing customer for many Cafe's myself and also asking friends and family and doing some online research I came up with these user stories.

#### New customer: 
- As a new customer I would want to learn about Roots.
- As a new customer I would like to know the opening times of the cafe.
- As a new customer I would like to know where the cafe is located and how to get there.
- As a new customer I would like to be able to get in contact with the cafe if I had any questions.
- As a new customer I would like some visuals of what to expect from the cafe.
- As a new customer I would like to see some reviews from previous customers.

#### Existing customer:

- As a customer who has already visited Roots cafe before I would like to be able to view the menu to see if anything new has been added/ to plan what I will eat. 
- As a new customer I would like to be able to get in contact to book a table/ if I have any questions
- As a new customer I would like to know the steps being taken to keep up with the current climate.

### Strategy

The main goal of the Roots website it to encourage potential new customers to chose this cafe over others in the area by providing them with all the information they may need. It also aims to keep existing customers informed on current situations which may have an effect on opening times of the cafe, and also to keep them up to date with the menu's and anything that might be new. 

##### Business Goals:

- Inform the customer of Menu options
- Give the customers visuals of what the food looks like

Reasons for change:

### Surface:

#### Design:

For the overall design of this project I wanted it to be very simple, clean and crisp with not too much going on but enough to portray all the information I needed in a professional way.

#### Typography:

The fonts that I decided to use for this project are Overpass and Raleway as they go together well. The fall back font that I used is sans-sherif.
Raleway has been used for headers and overpass has been used for body text.

## Testing

Throughout the building process of the website I have been checking Developer tools to ensure that the website is responsive on different devices. 
I have also been checking the website on my Iphone as found that sometimes the developer tools could be buggy and not always accurate. 

### Hero Image Cover text:
Whilst using developer tools I noticed that the cover text on the Hero image was not responsive, to fix this I added in a media querie for the cover text ID and changed the width to be 100% for smaller sizes.  

### Navbar Hamburger Menu:
Due to removing the Bootstrap styling from the navbar the hamburger icon disappeared. To fix this I added in a fontawesome icon to the span class "navbar-toggler-icon". The navbar wasn't centered so I added in CSS styling 'padding-top: 5px;" which fixed this. 
I have clearly mentioned in my CSS where I have overwritten some of the bootstrap styling. 

### Lighthouse:
Throughout the building process I was checking my website's performance using lighthouse in the developer tools. 


This has also been checking this on a larger screen size of 21inches.
