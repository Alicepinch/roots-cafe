[Roots Cafe Live Site](https://alicepinch.github.io/roots-cafe/)

![Ami responsive Screenshot](/docs/readme/ami-responsive.png)

This website is built for Roots cafe, a Vegetarian and Vegan Cafe. The website is built to inform customers on what food the Cafe offers via the menu & gallery section. An about us section with some background on why this was started, and also the location for customers to find the Cafe as well as a form to get in contact/book.

## UX

The UX goal for this website is to ensure the website is as clear as possible for customers to get to the information that they need. This will be achieved by a simple website structure with 3 seperate pages with the two different User journeys as the main focus. These focus's will be, New customers who are looking for a new cafe to visit who stumble upon Roots Cafe and Exisiting customers who want to get in contact/see whats new and view our menu.

## User Stories:

From being both a new customer and existing customer for many Cafe's myself and also asking friends and family and doing some online research I came up with these user stories.

#### New customer:

- As a new customer I would want to learn about Roots.
- As a new customer I would like to know the opening times of the cafe.
- As a new customer I would like to know where the cafe is located and how to get there.
- As a new customer I would like to be able to get in contact with the cafe if I had any questions.
- As a new customer I would like some visuals of what to expect from the cafe.
- As a new customer I would like to see some reviews from previous customers.

#### Existing customer:

- As a customer who has already visited Roots cafe before I would like to be able to view the menu to see if anything new has been added/ to plan what I will eat.
- As a new customer I would like to be able to get in contact to book a table/ if I have any questions
- As a new customer I would like to know the steps being taken to keep up with the current climate.

### Strategy
---

The main goal of the Roots website it to encourage potential new customers to chose this cafe over others in the area by providing them with all the information they may need. It also aims to keep existing customers informed on current situations which may have an effect on opening times of the cafe, and also to keep them up to date with the menu's and anything that might be new.

#### Business Goals:

### Surface:
---

#### Design:

For the overall design of this project I wanted it to be simple, clean and crisp with not too much going on which may overwhelm the customer.

#### Typography:

The first font that I decided to use for this project was Overpass from Googlefonts, it was recommended that Raleway complimeneted this font well so I chose to use this alongside. The fall back font that I used is sans-sherif.
Raleway has been used for headers and overpass has been used for body text.

#### Colour Scheme

As the colour green is normally associated with Vegetarianism and Veganism, I decided to use green as my main colour focus for this project. I want my website to be clean and crisp therefore I chose to stick with only green and not introduce any other bold colours.
For links and CTA's I have used the lighter green, and the darker green for when hoving over for contrast. I decided on a dark grey for the font colour and white for the background. I have also used the light green colour as background for some sections across the website to create consitency and break up the white.
