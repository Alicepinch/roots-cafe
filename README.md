# Roots Cafe

This website is built for Roots cafe, a Vegetarian and Vegan Cafe. The website is built to inform customers on what food the Cafe offers via the menu & gallery section. An about us section with some background on why this was started, and also the location for customers to find the Cafe as well as a form to get in contact/book.

## UX
The UX goal for this website is to ensure the website is as clear as possible for customers to get to the information that they need. This will be achieved by a simple website structure with 3 seperate pages with the two different User journeys as the main focus. These focus's will be, New customers who are looking for a new cafe to visit who stumble upon Roots Cafe and Exisiting customers who want to get in contact/see whats new and view our menu.  

## User Stories:

From being both a new customer and existing customer for many Cafe's myself and also asking friends and family and doing some online research I came up with these user stories.

#### New customer: 
- As a new customer I would want to learn a little about the cafe.
- As a new customer I would like to know the opening times of the cafe.
- As a new customer I would like to know where the cafe is located and how to get there.
- As a new customer I would like to be able to get in contact with the cafe if I had any questions.
- As a new customer I would like some visuals of what to expect from the cafe.
- As a new customer I would like to see some reviews from previous customers.

#### Existing customer:

- As a customer who has already visited Roots cafe before I would like to be able to view the menu to see if anything new has been added/ to plan what I will eat. 
- As a new customer I would like to be able to get in contact to book a table/ if I have any questions
- As a new customer I would like to know the steps being taken to keep up with the current climate.

### Strategy

The main goal of the Roots website it to encourage potential new customers to chose this cafe over others in the area by providing them with all the information they may need. It also aims to keep existing customers informed on current situations which may have an effect on opening times of the cafe, and also to keep them up to date with the menu's and anything that might be new. 

Business Goals:

- Inform the customer of Menu options

Original Wireframes:

Reasons for change:

### Surface:

#### Design:

For the overall design of this project I wanted it to be very simple and clean.

#### Typography:

The fonts that I decided to use for this project are Overpass and Raleway as they are both very simple. The fall back font that I used is sans-sherif.
Overpass has been used for headers and Raleway has been used for body text.

#### Colour Scheme

I wanted my design to be clean with not too many colours so I opted for t too many different colours so opted for variations of the same colour in deeper shades.

Throughout the building process of the 
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

---

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
